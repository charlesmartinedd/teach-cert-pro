## 🧪 Local Validation Tests

### 1. Development Server Startup
```bash
# Terminal 1: Start API
cd api && python main.py
# Expected: Server running on http://localhost:8000

# Terminal 2: Start Frontend
cd teacher-cert-platform && npm run dev
# Expected: Server running on http://localhost:3000
```

### 2. API Health Check
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/
# Expected: {"message": "TeachCertPro API is running"}

curl http://localhost:8000/states
# Expected: List of available states (California, Texas, etc.)
```

### 3. Frontend Validation
- [ ] Navigate to `http://localhost:3000`
- [ ] Homepage loads without errors
- [ ] All images and assets load correctly
- [ ] Navigation links work properly

### 4. Data Integration Testing
- [ ] Navigate to `/states`
- [ ] Page loads and shows "Loading State Data..." briefly
- [ ] Either shows state data or appropriate error message
- [ ] Search functionality works
- [ ] State cards are clickable
- [ ] Statistics display correctly

### 5. Mobile Responsiveness
- [ ] Test on mobile viewport (375x667)
- [ ] Navigation works on touch devices
- [ ] Content is readable without horizontal scrolling
- [ ] Buttons and links are appropriately sized

### 6. Cross-browser Testing
